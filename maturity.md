# Maturity level for CLIF

CLIF is an evolving format and some parts of the format are more mature than others. Specifically, the ER model and the tables have two different maturity levels

## Maturity level for CLIF entity-relationship model

- **Experimental**: Majority of critical illness and hospital course not represented in ER model, expect frequent breaking changes.
- **Beta**: ER model complete and actively seeking feedback. 
- **Stable**: Tested and recommended for general use.
- **Mature**: Widely adopted and very stable.
- **Deprecated**: No longer maintained.

The entity-relationship model for this project is currently at the **Beta** level. We are actively seeking feedback and will move to Stable once more testing is completed.

## Maturity Levels for CLIF tables

There are two critical maturity elements for each CLIF table: 1) field structure and 2) Common ICU data Element development.

- **Concept**: Placeholder for future CLIF table. Majority of table structure and CDE elements incomplete. Expect breaking changes.
- **Beta**: Table structure and field names complete, but not fully tested. CDE for category variables not defined.
- **Stable**: Tested and recommended for general use. CDE stable with permissible values for all category variables precisely defined and locked.
- **Mature**: Widely adopted across the CLIF consortium and very stable.
- **Deprecated**: No longer maintained.
